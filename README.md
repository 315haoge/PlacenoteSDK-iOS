# Placenote SDK for iOS

Placenote SDK lets you easily build cloud-based Augmented Reality (AR) apps that pin digital content to locations in the real world. The SDK is compatible with all ARKit enabled phones and can be used to create persistent augmented reality experiences using Swift and SceneKit.

The SDK includes 3 sample Xcode projects that you can use as starting points for your projects.
